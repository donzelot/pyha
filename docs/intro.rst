Pyha is a name for my side project that i wish to turn into the thesis work. Essentially it is a Python to VHDL converter, with a specific focus on implementing DSP systems.

Here are the main features:
    - Strong fixed point type support(maps to VHDLs fixed point library)
    - Sequential coding
    - Object oriented coding
    - Test driven development
    - Model based design
