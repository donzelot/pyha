Introduction
============

Essentially it is a Python to VHDL converter, with a specific focus on implementing DSP systems.

Here are the main features:
    - Strong fixed point type support(maps to VHDLs fixed point library)
    - Sequential coding
    - Object oriented coding
    - Test driven development
    - Model based design


Example of converting very deep sequential stuff. Good quality of VHDL output.

Reccommend pycharm as development platform.


Limitations
-----------

- Only one clock
-
